# AutomationHW
Automated tests for a Web application
## Getting Started
The project does automated testing for [oranum.com](https://oranum.com/en/home).
Oranum is the world’s largest spiritual community, and the only live webcam platform that allows users to video chat with psychics and spiritual advisors live and in the comfort of their own home. Though recognized worldwide for its psychics, anyone with a spiritual message or skill (ranging from horoscope, dream interpretation, reiki healing, tarot card reading, meditation, clairvoyance, to even spell casting) can use Oranum. Oranum’s mission is to help connect, inspire and empower the world’s spiritual community by bringing ancient knowledge to the digital age.
